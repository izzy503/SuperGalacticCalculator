## Super Galactic Age Calculator

TThis is a unique application that determines a user's age based on a planet's solar years. While a solar year on Earth is familiar to most of us, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. For instance, a solar year on Mercury lasts only 88 days.

## Features

Calculate Age in Planetary Years:

Converts a person's age in Earth years to:

Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)

Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)

Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)

Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)

Past Birthday Calculations: Determines how many years have passed on each planet since a past birthday.

Future Birthday Calculations: Determines how many years have yet to pass on each planet until a future birthday.

## Technologies Used

## Usage 

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/izzy503/SuperGalacticAgeCalculator.git


Make sure you have node and npm installed. Navigate to the directory and install the required packages:

Copy code
npm install
Run the tests:

bash

npm test
Use the methods in the codebase as per your requirements.

## Known Bugs

None found.

## Test

Ensure you follow the Red, Green, Refactor workflow:

Red Phase: Commit each test after you have written it and before writing the corresponding method in your business logic.
Green Phase: Write the business logic that corresponds to the test, verify that your test passes, and then commit your code.
Refactor: Enhance your codebase and tests as necessary.
At the end of your work session, make sure you have 100% coverage on all tests.
